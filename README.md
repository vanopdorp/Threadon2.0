# 🚀 Threadon: A Blazing Fast Programming Language  

Are you a Python developer frustrated by slow code execution?  
Meet **Threadon** — a modern, compiled language that looks like statically typed Python but runs with the raw speed of C++.

---

## ⚡ Why Threadon?
- **C++ performance**: Threadon compiles directly to C++, giving you the same speed and efficiency.  
- **Python-like syntax**: Write code that feels familiar, but with static typing for safety and speed.  
- **Full C++ compatibility**: Seamlessly use the entire C++ Standard Library (STL) and other C++ libraries.  
- **Lightweight core**: A minimal built-in library, so you can extend with STL or your favorite C++ frameworks.

## 📝 Example Code
```threadon
def main():
    int x = 1
    float y = 3.14
    string z = "hello world"
    print(x, y, z)
```
